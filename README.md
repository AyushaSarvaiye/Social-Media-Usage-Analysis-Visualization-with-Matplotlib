**Social Media Usage Analysis & Visualization with Matplotlib**

#DataSet --

This project analyzes social media usage data across different countries and visualizes insights using Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib library. It demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and multiple chart types, including bar plots, pie charts, and treemaps.

Overview:

This project explores a dataset containing social media platform usage statistics by country. The goal is to visualize which platforms are most popular and understand global trends. The analysis helps in identifying patterns, regional preferences, and platform dominance.


1. Distribution of Academic Levels of Social Media Users

This visualization shows how social media users are distributed across different academic levels (e.g., High School, Undergraduate, Postgraduate). It helps understand which education groups are most active on social media and can guide targeted analysis or marketing strategies.

Example Text:

The chart displays the proportion of social media users by their academic level, highlighting which groups are most engaged with various platforms.

2. Most Used Social Media Platforms (Counts)

This chart shows the total number of users for each social media platform. It helps identify which platforms are most popular overall. Counts give a clear, quantitative measure of platform preference.

Example Text:

This bar chart presents the number of users per social media platform, showing the popularity of each platform among the surveyed population.

3. Social Media Usage by Country (Treemap)

A treemap shows how social media usage varies across countries. Each rectangle represents a country, and its size corresponds to the number of users. This makes it easy to compare relative usage geographically.

Example Text:

The treemap visualizes social media user distribution by country. Larger rectangles indicate higher user counts, making it easy to spot countries with the most social media engagement.

4. Relationship Between Usage Hours and Addiction Score

This scatter plot (or correlation chart) explores the relationship between the number of hours spent on social media and an addiction score. It helps identify trends, e.g., whether higher usage correlates with higher addiction risk.

Example Text:

This visualization shows the correlation between daily social media usage (hours) and addiction score. It helps understand how prolonged usage may relate to addictive behavior.
